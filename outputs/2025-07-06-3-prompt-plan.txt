2025-07-07 02:26:50,990 - main - INFO - Response generated: It appears that finding a 14th-generation Intel CPU under 200 euros in Zagreb, Croatia, might be challenging, as the prices for these newer models typically exceed this budget. However, you could consider the following options:

1. **Older Generations**: Look for 12th or 13th-generation Intel CPUs, which might fit your budget better.
2. **Local Queries**: Visit physical stores in Zagreb (e.g., **Links**, **Bug**, or **Instar Informatika**) to inquire about availability and discounts.
3. **Used Market**: Check platforms like **Njuskalo.hr** for second-hand options.

If you'd like, I can assist further by refining the search or exploring alternative components. Let me know!
