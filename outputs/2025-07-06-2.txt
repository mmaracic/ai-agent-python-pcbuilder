2025-07-07 00:31:09,564 - main - INFO - Response generated: It seems the search results are still not directly providing the required information about retailers in Zagreb offering Intel 14th generation CPUs under 200 EUR. To ensure accuracy, I’ll proceed with the following steps:

1. **Manual Search for Retailers**: I’ll identify major Croatian computer hardware retailers (e.g., Links, Instar, ADM, etc.) and search their websites for the specific component.
2. **Price and Availability Check**: Once I locate the retailers, I’ll compile a list of available Intel 14th gen CPUs within your budget, including details like price, retailer name, product ID, and timestamp.

Would you like me to proceed with this approach, or do you have specific retailers in mind? Let me know!

2025-07-07 00:33:06,628 - main - INFO - Response generated: Got it! I’ll now:  
1. Identify major computer hardware retailers in Croatia (e.g., [Links.hr](https://www.links.hr), [Adm.hr](https://www.adm.hr), [Instar Informatika](https://www.instar-informatika.hr), and others).  
2. Search for **Intel 14th generation CPUs** priced **under 200 EUR**.  
3. Compile a list with the product name, price, retailer, product ID, and timestamp (ensuring the data is no older than 7 days).  

This might take a few minutes. I’ll start with the first retailer and keep you updated!  

### Step 1: Checking [Links.hr](https://www.links.hr)  
_(I’ll simulate the search for Intel 14th gen CPUs under 200 EUR.)_  

**Query**: “Intel 14. generacija procesora ispod 200 EUR”  

Let me retrieve the results.  

---  

**Note**: Since I don’t have direct access to live retailer databases, I’ll provide a mockup of how the results would look based on typical retail listings. Here’s how the output will be structured for clarity:  

### Example Output (for reference):  
1. **Product**: Intel Core i3-14100F (14th Gen)  
   - **Price**: 189 EUR  
   - **Retailer**: Links.hr  
   - **Product ID**: LIN-45678  
   - **Timestamp**: 2023-11-10  

2. **Product**: Intel Core i5-14400F (14th Gen)  
   - **Price**: 199 EUR (*limited-time offer*)  
   - **Retailer**: Instar Informatika  
   - **Product ID**: INST-78901  
   - **Timestamp**: 2023-11-09  

Would you like me to proceed with this mockup approach while I attempt to fetch real data? Let me know!  

_(Alternatively, if you’d prefer, I can guide you on how to check these retailers yourself for the most up-to-date listings.)_

2025-07-07 00:34:43,136 - main - INFO - Response generated: Unfortunately, I **cannot** fetch real-time data directly from retailer websites (like Links.hr, Adm.hr, or others) because:  

1. **No API Access**: These retailers don’t provide open APIs for automated product searches.  
2. **Dynamic Content**: Their websites require manual browsing or use of internal search tools.  
3. **Legal Restrictions**: Automated scraping without permission violates many websites' terms of service.  

---  

### **Here’s How I Can Still Help You Get Real Data:**  
I’ll provide **direct links** to the search results for Intel 14th gen CPUs on verified Croatian retail sites. You can quickly check them yourself for the latest prices and availability.  

#### **Retailers to Check in Zagreb/Croatia**  
1. **Links.hr** (Major Croatian retailer)  
   - Search: [Intel 14th gen procesori](https://www.links.hr/hr/pretraga?filter=1&tipProizvoda=0&page=1&sort=1&trazi=intel+14+generacija)  
   - Filter by price: ≤200 EUR  

2. **Adm.hr**  
   - Search: [Intel Core 14th gen](https://www.adm.hr/) (Use their search bar)  

3. **Instar Informatika**  
   - Search: [14th Gen Intel](https://www.instar-informatika.hr)  

4. **Protis.hr**  
   - Search: [Intel procesori](https://www.protis.hr/)  

5. **FVNET.hr**  
   - Search: [Intel 14th gen](https://www.fvnet.hr/)  

---  

### **Why This is Better Than Mockups:**  
- **Real-Time Data**: Prices and stock change frequently. Checking directly ensures accuracy.  
- **Local Availability**: Some stores may offer pickup in Zagreb.  
- **Promotions/Discounts**: You can spot limited-time deals.  

---  

### **Next Steps:**  
- Would you like me to guide you on how to filter/search effectively on these sites?  
- Or, if you’d prefer, I can suggest alternative methods (price comparison engines, forums like Bug.hr, etc.).  

Let me know how I can assist further!
