2025-07-07 00:21:50,666 - main - INFO - Response generated: Unfortunately, even with a broader search, I am struggling to find definitive listings for Intel 14th generation CPUs under 200 euros in Croatia. The search results are quite generic and don't provide specific product prices from retailers.

It's possible that:

*   **Availability:** 14th generation Intel CPUs might be priced higher than 200 euros in Croatia, or not widely available yet.
*   **Retailer Information:** The retailers I initially identified might not have up-to-date online catalogs that are easily searchable.
*   **Search Limitations:** My search tool might not be effectively scraping the pricing data from Croatian retailer websites.

Given these limitations, I cannot fulfill the request to provide a list of ten components with the required information (name, price, retailer, ID, timestamp).

I recommend you to manually browse the websites of local computer parts retailers in Zagreb, such as Adarc Computer and Futura IT, or visit local stores. You can also check larger online marketplaces that operate in Croatia. This direct approach will likely yield more accurate and up-to-date pricing information.
