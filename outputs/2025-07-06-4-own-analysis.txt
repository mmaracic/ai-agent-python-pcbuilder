2025-07-07 02:50:09,351 - main - INFO - Response generated: It seems the broader search did not yield specific results for 14th-generation Intel CPUs under 200 euros in Zagreb, Croatia. Here’s what I can conclude:

1. **Limited Availability**: 14th-generation Intel CPUs may not be available at or below 200 euros in local retailers or online stores in Zagreb, Croatia.
2. **Alternative Suggestions**:
   - Consider older-generation Intel CPUs (e.g., 12th or 13th generation) that might fit your budget.
   - Expand your budget slightly to accommodate higher-priced 14th-generation CPUs.
   - Look for used or refurbished options if you're open to them.

If you'd like, I can provide a list of alternative CPUs (older generations or other brands) within your budget or assist further. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
