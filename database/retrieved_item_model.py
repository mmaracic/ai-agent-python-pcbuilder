"""
Pydantic model for retrieving items from the database, including store information, extraction timestamp, and similarity score.

This module defines the `RetrievedDatabaseExtractedItem` class, which is intended for use as a retrieval model when loading item records from the database. It encapsulates all relevant data for an item as stored in the database, such as price, description, store name, extraction time, and a similarity score for search or ranking purposes.

Note:
    This model does not include the vector embedding itself; only metadata and similarity scores are retrieved.
